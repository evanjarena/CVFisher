- plot_result.py <- shows how to read and use the files written by the previous script

## Requirements:

- numpy
- scipy
- [cosmomad](https://github.com/damonge/CosmoMAD)

## Disclaimer:

This has been a super-quick copy-paste of code written for various projects. Let me know of any significant disagreement with other codes (which are probably due to missing factors of 2 here and there)
